# REPO-TODO.md

Short list of things to work on for the game template.

### Todo (Template)

The template will encompass a basic project structure, some bootstrapped Global
management singletons, and basic menu system.

- [ ] Make menu system nicer for panel transitions
- [ ] Make dropdown directory selection for "Game Scenes" / Templates (Asteroids should be one of these)
- [ ] Make secondary "Game Scene"

### Todo (Asteroid)

Asteroids is an example of a game that could exist within godot framework.
It is meant to be a playable example of a contained scene/game environment.

- [ ] add level difficulty / increase with progression
- [ ] bug where player state is stuck in "moving" while respawning
